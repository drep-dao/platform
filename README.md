# DRep DAO (governance edition)

> This repository is the **DRep DAO** edition, split from
> [Innovation & Growth](https://github.com/innovation-and-growth-dao/platform). Funding proposals,
> rounds, tally/filtering/milestone voting are **removed**; instead, approved
> submitters file **Requests** (title + description) to the DReps — free, or paid
> via board-priced request types whose fee is verified on-chain before the request
> enters the queue. The treasury uses a fixed bucket set: Main, Request fees,
> Operations, Rewards.

A self-hosted web platform for a Cardano governance DAO: DReps handle submitter
requests, run internal governance votes, manage a 3-of-5 native multisig treasury,
and pay rewards. The backend + Postgres are the
**source of truth**; the chain is used for wallet auth (CIP-30/CIP-8), DRep identity
(CIP-95), the multisig treasury, fee/pledge verification, and daily Merkle-hash
**anchoring** for independent verifiability. There is **no Plutus/Aiken on-chain logic**
(see design §21.2).

Full design: [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).

Monorepo: **pnpm workspaces + Turborepo**. Stack per design §21.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20 (this repo is developed on 24)
- pnpm 9 (`corepack enable pnpm`)
- Docker + Docker Compose, for local Postgres 16 + Redis 7
  - On WSL2: install **Docker Desktop** and enable WSL integration for this distro
    (Settings → Resources → WSL integration), or install the docker engine inside WSL.

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env          # edit secrets as needed

# 3. Start local Postgres + Redis
pnpm infra:up                 # docker compose up -d (needs Docker running)

# 4. Create the database schema and seed defaults
pnpm db:generate              # generate the Prisma client
pnpm db:migrate               # apply migrations (needs the DB running)
pnpm db:seed                  # seed platform_config + subcategories

# 5. Run everything in dev
pnpm dev                      # web on :3000, api on :4000
```

## Delivery phases

This repo follows the phased MVP cut in design §27. Current status: **scaffold + running
skeleton**. Next vertical slice (§28.5): wallet login → DRep admission → admin rounds UI.
